Jimp 2 is a free program for visualizing and manipulating molecules. It was written by Josiah Manson and Charles Edwin Webster under the supervision of Dr. Michael Hall and was funded by the Texas A&M Department of Chemistry and the National Science Foundation under grants: CHE-9800184, CHE-0518078, and CHE-0541587. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

Since its predecessor, Jimp 2 was started completely fresh. One of the most basic changes that users will notice is that Jimp 2 has its data organized in a hierarchical tree structure, compared to the layer structure of Jimp. Internally, there are several major changes; one of the bigger changes is that everything is driven by a scripting language (written by one of the authors, Josiah Manson). Scripting allows for tedious tasks to be automated. As well, every action done through the GUI is executed through the scripting language and logged, so it is easy to generate macros and to learn how the scripting works.

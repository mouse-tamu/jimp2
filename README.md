Introducing Jimp 2

<blockquote>\Jimp\, a. [Cf. Gimp, a.] Neat; handsome; elegant. See Gimp.<br>

Jimp 2 is a free program for visualizing and manipulating molecules. It was written by Josiah Manson and Charles Edwin Webster under the supervision of Dr. Michael Hall and was funded by the Texas A&M Department of Chemistry and the National Science Foundation under grants: CHE-9800184, CHE-0518078, and CHE-0541587. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

All publications and/or presentations that result from the use of Jimp 2 should contain the following references: Hall, M. B.; Fenske, R. F. Inorg. Chem. 1972, 11, 768-779. Bursten, B. E.; Jensen, J.

Since its predecessor, Jimp 2 was started completely fresh. One of the most basic changes that users will notice is that Jimp 2 has its data organized in a hierarchical tree structure, compared to the layer structure of Jimp. Internally, there are several major changes; one of the bigger changes is that everything is driven by a scripting language (written by one of the authors, Josiah Manson). Scripting allows for tedious tasks to be automated. As well, every action done through the GUI is executed through the scripting language and logged, so it is easy to generate macros and to learn how the scripting works.

Jimp 2 is a licensed program, and use of this program implies acceptance of the terms of the following license:
A license does not entitle the licensee to redistribute or relicense the source code or executable code, in original or modified form, to a party not covered by this license.  An individual user license covers the work of a single user and a group leader license covers the work of a single research group; in the latter case the code may be shared and disseminated within a group without additional permission; the group leader is charged with preventing unauthorized distribution.  This is not a site license; site-license inquiries should be directed to the principal investigator (M.B.H.).
Exceptions to the license require written permission of the principal investigator.

The licensee has no ownership rights in the Jimp 2 software or in any copyrights for the Jimp 2 software or documentation through this license.

Publications resulting from using Jimp 2<sup>1</sup> (the program for building, manipulating, and visualizing structures; and launching FENSKE-HALL, launching MOPLOT2, and visualizing their calculational results), FENSKE-HALL<sup>2-3</sup> (the program which performs the SCF calculation), and/or MOPLOT2<sup>4,/sup> (the program that creates the orbitals for visualization) programs in this package must cite the corresponding program.  The user takes full responsibility for proper licensing and referencing of any third party programs used in conjunction with Jimp 2.

No guarantee is made that this program is bug-free or suitable for specific applications, and no liability is accepted for any limitations in the mathematical methods and algorithms used within the program.
